# Content Template for CreepJS Fingerprinting Pages

## Structure (Following E-E-A-T Principles)

### 1. H1 Title (Must contain core keyword)

Example: "Canvas Fingerprinting: How Browsers Create Your Digital Identity"

### 2. Opening Hook (Elon Musk Style - Direct & Simple)

- Start with a relatable scenario
- Explain like talking to a friend
- No technical jargon in first paragraph
- ~100 words

Example:

> Okay, so here's the thing nobody tells you: Your browser is basically snitching on you. Not in a creepy Big Brother way (well, maybe a little), but in a way that's actually pretty clever. Every time your browser draws something on your screen, it does it slightly differently than everyone else's browser. It's like asking 100 people to draw the same circle—they'll all look similar, but none will be exactly identical. That's canvas fingerprinting in a nutshell.

### 3. What It Is (H2)

- Simple explanation
- Real-world analogy
- Why it exists
- ~150-200 words

### 4. How It Actually Works (H2)

- ~200-250 words

### 5. The Numbers Don't Lie (H2) - **STATISTICS TABLE**

- Present latest research data
- Use markdown tables
- Include sources
- Compare with other methods
- ~150-200 words + table

Example Table:
| Metric | Value | Source | Year |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| Unique identification rate | 99%+ (combined) | [Source] | 2025 |
| Entropy bits | 5.7 bits | [Study] | 2024 |
| Website adoption | 10,000+ sites | [Research] | 2025 |

### 6. Real-World Applications (H2)

- List 4-6 use cases
- Explain good and bad uses

### 7. **UNIQUE INCREMENTAL INFORMATION** (H2)

Title varies: "What Nobody Tells You About [Technique]" or "The Hidden Truth About [Technique]"

- This section MUST provide NEW insights
- Compare different browsers/OS

- Include edge cases
- ~200-250 words

Examples of incremental info:

- "We tested 1000 devices and found that iPhone users with the same model still have 87% unique fingerprints"
- "Linux users are actually easier to track because there are fewer of them"
- "Private browsing doesn't help as much as you think—here's why"
